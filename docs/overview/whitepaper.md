# Whitepaper


## Development Approach

Instead of releasing a whitepaper in the early stages, Qubic will only publish a whitepaper upon completion of its development. This approach ensures that all the information in the whitepaper will be accurate and up-to-date, avoiding the common pitfall of many projects whose actual development diverges from their initial whitepaper.
