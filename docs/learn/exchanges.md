## Over The Counter (OTC) Transactions

In addition to the exchanges listed above, you can also buy or sell QUs through Over The Counter (OTC) transactions.

OTC transactions refer to deals that take place directly between two parties without the supervision of an exchange. 

You can participate in OTC transactions via the [Qubic Discord Server](https://discord.com/channels/768887649540243497/938806734212984853). Upon joining the server, navigate to the #otc channel where you can find posts by users who wish to buy or sell QUs.

Please be aware that OTC transactions carry their own risks, as they lack the regulatory oversight provided by exchanges. We recommend taking precautions such as using an escrow service to ensure the security of your transactions.

## Upcoming Qx Exchange

The Qx exchange will be Qubic's very own decentralized exchange. It is currently in development and more information will be provided once it's ready to be launched. 

Stay tuned to our updates for more information about Qx and the future trading of QUs.
