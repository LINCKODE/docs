# Running a Computor in the Qubic Network: The Challenges

The Qubic network, with its revolutionary approach to decentralized computing and smart contracts, has introduced a unique role known as the "Computor." While this node type plays a pivotal role in executing tasks, maintaining the tokenomic balance, and making crucial network decisions, operating a Computor is not straightforward. Here are some reasons why running a Computor can be intricate:

1. **Bare Metal Requirement**: Unlike many other systems that allow for virtualized or containerized environments, running a Computor demands operations on bare metal. This means potential operators need direct control over the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), which can be technically challenging and demands a solid understanding of computer hardware.

2. **Continuous Compilation**: Computor operators need to compile qubic.cpp at least once every epoch. Regular compilation can be cumbersome and requires consistent monitoring and technical know-how.

3. **Persistent Updates**: The dynamic nature of the Qubic network means updates are frequent. Computor operators need to stay on their toes to perform all updates as and when they roll out to ensure their node remains functional and compatible.

4. **Redundancy is Key**: To guarantee uninterrupted service and revenue, Computor operators must have backup systems in place (MAIN/AUX). This is to ensure the node continues ticking even if the primary system encounters issues like freezes.

5. **Competitive Nature**: Holding onto a Computor's spot is no easy task. With a maximum of 676 Computor spots available, operators need to consistently outperform candidates eyeing their position. This involves maintaining a high score, which reflects the Computor's efficiency and contribution to the network.

6. **Evolution and Adaptability**: As the Qubic network continues to evolve, so will the demands and challenges associated with running a Computor. Adapting to these changes quickly and efficiently will be crucial for sustained operation.

In summary, while being a Computor in the Qubic network comes with its set of advantages and rewards, it also demands technical expertise, vigilance, and adaptability. Those looking to operate a Computor should be prepared for the challenges and responsibilities that come with this crucial role.
