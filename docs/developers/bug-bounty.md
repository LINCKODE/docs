# Qubic Bug Bounty Program

Welcome to the Qubic Bug Bounty Program! We believe in a safe and secure ecosystem for our users, which is why we encourage and incentivize the identification and reporting of any potential security vulnerabilities in our system.

## Scope

All aspects of the Qubic ecosystem are in scope, including but not limited to:

- Core protocol
- Qubic Units (QUs)
- Smart Contracts
- Wallet software

## Rules

1. **Responsible Disclosure:** Do not disclose the details of the bug publicly before it has been addressed and a patch has been released.
2. **No Harm:** Do not exploit the bug beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it.
3. **Do Not Interfere:** Avoid disrupting any services or data during your testing.

## Reporting

Please submit a detailed bug report to `tbd@qubic.world` including the following information:

- Description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact

Reports that do not include this information may not qualify for a bounty.

## Rewards

Bounties will be awarded at the discretion of the Qubic development team based on the severity and impact of the reported issue. A minimum of 1 bln QUs will be awarded for any legitimate and previously unreported security vulnerability.

## Acknowledgments

Successful participants who help make the Qubic ecosystem more secure will be acknowledged publicly (unless they prefer to remain anonymous). Together, we can build a more secure and robust Qubic ecosystem.
